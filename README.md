Password Calculator Gnome Shell Extension

This app calculates strong passwords for each alias from your single secret.

No need to remember dozens of passwords any longer.
No need for a password manager any longer.
Full freedom in choosing aliases and secret, e.g. alias: "username@google.com#2014" secret: "saFe⚿in漢字"

Recent aliases are kept in a easily accessible drop-down.

The formula is as simple as "[secret][alias]" → SHA1 → BASE64
