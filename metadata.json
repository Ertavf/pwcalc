	"description": "This app calculates strong passwords for each alias from your single secret.  No need to remember dozens of passwords any longer. No need for a password manager any longer. Full freedom in choosing aliases and secret, e.g. alias: \"username@google.com#2014\" secret: \"saFe⚿in漢字\"  Recent aliases are kept in a easily accessible drop-down.  The formula is as simple as \"[secret][alias]\" → SHA1 → BASE64",
